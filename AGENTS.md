# Repository Guidelines

- Keep the documentation in `README.md` in sync with recent feature changes and CLI options.
- When modifying the Python code, favor clear function-level docstrings over inline comments for new logic.
- Run available linters or sanity checks when adding dependencies; document any skipped checks in your PR description.
- For documentation-only changes, describe the rationale behind updates so future contributors understand the context.
- Keep Python formatting consistent by running `black` and `isort` (configured via `pyproject.toml`) before committing code changes.
