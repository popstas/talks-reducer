# Repository Guidelines

- Keep the documentation in `README.md` in sync with recent feature changes and CLI options.
- When modifying the Python code, favor clear function-level docstrings over inline comments for new logic.
- Run available linters or sanity checks when adding dependencies; document any skipped checks in your PR description.
- For documentation-only changes, describe the rationale behind updates so future contributors understand the context.
- Keep Python formatting consistent by running `black` and `isort` (configured via `pyproject.toml`) before committing code changes.


### Graphical Interface

- **Simple mode** — the default experience shrinks the window to a large drop
  zone, hides the manual run controls and log, and automatically processes new
  files as soon as you drop them. Uncheck the box to return to the full layout
  with file pickers, the Run button, and detailed logging.
- **Input drop zone** — drag files or folders from your desktop, click to open
  the system file picker, or add them via the Explorer/Finder dialog; duplicates
  are ignored.
- **Small video** — toggles the `--small` preset used by the CLI.
- **Open after convert** — controls whether the exported file is revealed in
  your system file manager as soon as each job finishes.
- **Advanced** — reveals optional controls for the output path, temp folder,
  timing/audio knobs mirrored from the command line, and an appearance picker
  that can force dark or light mode or follow your operating system.

Progress updates stream into the 10-line log panel while the processing runs in
a background thread. Once every queued job succeeds an **Open last output**
button appears so you can jump straight to the exported file in your system
file manager.

The GUI stores your last-used Simple mode, Small video, Open after convert, and
theme preferences in a cross-platform configuration file so they persist across
launches.

## Repository Structure
- `talks_reducer/` — Python package that exposes the CLI and reusable pipeline:
  - `cli.py` parses arguments and dispatches to the pipeline.
  - `pipeline.py` orchestrates FFmpeg, audio processing, and temporary assets.
  - `audio.py` handles audio validation, volume analysis, and phase vocoder processing.
  - `chunks.py` builds timing metadata and FFmpeg expressions for frame selection.
  - `ffmpeg.py` discovers the FFmpeg binary, checks CUDA availability, and assembles command strings.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for local development.
- `default.nix` — reproducible environment definition for Nix users.
- `CONTRIBUTION.md` — development workflow, formatting expectations, and release checklist.
- `AGENTS.md` — maintainer tips and coding conventions for this repository.

## Highlights
- Builds on gegell's classic jumpcutter workflow with more efficient frame and audio processing
- Generates FFmpeg filter graphs instead of writing temporary frames to disk
- Streams audio transformations in memory to avoid slow intermediate files
- Accepts multiple inputs or directories of recordings in a single run
- Provides progress feedback via `tqdm`
- Automatically detects NVENC availability, so you no longer need to pass `--cuda`

## Processing Pipeline
1. Validate that each input file contains an audio stream using `ffprobe`.
2. Extract audio and calculate loudness to identify silent regions.
3. Stretch the non-silent segments with `audiotsm` to maintain speech clarity.
4. Stitch the processed audio and video together with FFmpeg, using NVENC if the GPU encoders are detected.
